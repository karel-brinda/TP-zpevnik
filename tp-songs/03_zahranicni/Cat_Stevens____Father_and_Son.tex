It's not \Ch{G}{time} to make a \Ch{D}{change}, just \Ch{C}{relax}, take it \Ch{Ami7}{easy}

You're still \Ch{G}{young}, that's your \Ch{Emi}{fault}, there's so \Ch{Ami}{much} you have to \Ch{D}{know}

Find a \Ch{G}{girl}, settle \Ch{D}{down}, if you \Ch{C}{want} you can \Ch{Ami7}{marry}

Look at \Ch{G}{me,} I am \Ch{Emi}{old but} I'm \Ch{Ami}{happy}\Ch{C}{} \Ch{D}{}
\ks

\zs
I was \Ch{G}{once} like you are \Ch{Bmi7}{now,} and I \Ch{C}{know} that it's not \Ch{Ami7}{easy}

To be \Ch{G}{calm} when you've \Ch{Emi}{found} something going \Ch{Ami}{on} \Ch{C}{} \Ch{D}{}

But take your \Ch{G}{time}, think a \Ch{Bmi7}{lot, think} \Ch{C}{of} everything you'\Ch{Ami7}{ve got}

For you will \Ch{G}{still} be here to\Ch{Emi}{morrow}, but your \Ch{D}{dreams} may \Ch{G}{not} \Ch{G/C}{} \Ch{G/C}{}

Son

How can \Ch{G}{I try} to \Ch{Bmi}{explain}, when I \Ch{C}{do} he turns away a\Ch{Ami7}{gain}

It's \Ch{G}{always} been the \Ch{Emi}{same}, same old \Ch{Ami}{story} \Ch{C}{} \Ch{D}{}

From the \Ch{G}{moment} I could \Ch{Bmi}{talk} I was \Ch{C}{ordered} to \Ch{Ami7}{listen}

Now there's a \Ch{G}{way} and I \Ch{Emi}{know} that I \Ch{D}{have} to \Ch{G}{go} away

I \Ch{D}{know} I \Ch{C}{have} to \Ch{G}{go} \Ch{G/C}{} \Ch{G/C}{}\\

It's not time to make a change, just sit down, take it slowly

You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through

Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry

Look at me, I am old but I'm happy
\ks

Son
\zs
All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside

It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them, they know not me

Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away

I know I have to go
