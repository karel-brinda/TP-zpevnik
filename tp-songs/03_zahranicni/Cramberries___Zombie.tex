Another head hangs lowly, 

child is slowly taken.
 
And the violence caused such silence.
 
Who are we mistaken?
 
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family,

in your head, in your head they are fighting.
\ks

\zr 
With their tanks, and their bombs,

and their bombs, and their guns

in your head, in your head they are cryin'.
 
In your head, in your head, Zombie, Zombie, Zombie - 

ie - ie. 

What's in your head, in your head,

Zombie, Zombie, Zombie - ie - ie - ie - Emioh.

Another mother's breakin' 

heart is taking over. 

When the violence causes silence 

we must be mistaken. 

It's the same old theme since 1916, 

in your head, in your head they're still fightin'.
