\zp{Those were the days}{Mary Hopkin}

\zs
\Ch{Emi}{Once upon} a time there was a tavern

\Ch{E7}{Where} we used to raise a glass or \Ch{Ami}{two}

Remember how we laughed away the \Ch{Emi}{hours}

And \Ch{H7}{think} of all the great things we would do
\ks

\zr
Those were the \Ch{Emi}{days, my friend}

We thought they'd \Ch{Ami}{never end}

We'd sing and \Ch{D}{dance} for ever and a \Ch{G}{day}

We'd live the \Ch{Ami}{life we choose}

We'd fight and \Ch{Emi}{never lose}

For we were \Ch{H7}{young} and sure to have our \Ch{Emi}{way}

La la la la la la...

\zs
Then the busy years went rushing by us

We lost our starry notions on the way

If by chance I'd see you in the tavern

We'd smile at one another and we'd say
\ks

\zr\kr

\zs
Just tonight I stood before the tavern

Nothing seemed the way it used to be

In the glass I saw a strange reflection

Was that lonely woman really me?
\ks

\zr\kr

\zs
Through the door there came familiar laughter

I saw your face and heard you call my name

Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser

For in our hearts the dreams are still the same
