\zp{Fuking Perfect}{Pink}

\zs
 Made a \Ch{G}{wrong} turn, once \Ch{Dsus}{or twice}. Dug my \Ch{Em7}{way} out, blood and \Ch{Cadd9}{fire}

Bad decisions. That's alright, welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, missundaztood. Miss "no way it's all good"

It didn't slow me down. Mistaken. Always second guessing

Underestimated, look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please. Don't you ever, ever feel

Like your less than, fuckin' perfect

Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel

Like your no thing, you're fuckin perfect to me

You're so mean. When you talk about yourself. You are wrong. 

Change the voices in your head. Make them like you instead.

So complicated. Look happy you'll make it. Filled with so much hatred. Such a tired game

It's enough. I've done all I can think of. Chased down all my demons. See you do the same

The whole world's scare so I swallow the fear

The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer

So cool in line and we try, try, try

But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time

Done looking for critics, cuz they're everywhere

They don't like me jeans, they don't get my hair

Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time

Why do we do that

Why do I do that

Why do I do that
