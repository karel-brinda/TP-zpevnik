\Ch{G}{We} all came out to Montreux

On the Lake Ge\Ch{F}{neva} \Ch{G}{shoreline}

To make records with a mobile

We didn't have much time

Frank Zappa and the Mothers

Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun

Burned the place to the ground

They burned down the gambling house,
it died with an awful sound

Funky \& Claude was running in and out,
pulling kids out the ground

When it all was over,
we had to find another place

But Swiss time was running out

It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
\ks

\zs
We ended up at the Grand Hotel,
it was empty cold and bare

But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside

Making our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds,
we make a place to sweat

No matter what we get out of this,
I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
