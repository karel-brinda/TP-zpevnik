\Ch{Gm7}{I don't} know \Ch{C7}{why I didn't} \Ch{F7sus}{come} \Ch{Bb}{~}

I left you by the house of fun

I don't know why I didn't come

I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day

I wished that I could fly away

Instead of kneeling in the sand

Catching teardrops in my hand

Out       across the endless sea

I would die in ecstasy

But I'll     be a bag of bones

Driving down the road alone

Something has to make you run

I don't know why I didn't come

I feel as empty as a drum

I don't know why I didn't come

I don't know why I didn't come

I don't know why I didn't come
