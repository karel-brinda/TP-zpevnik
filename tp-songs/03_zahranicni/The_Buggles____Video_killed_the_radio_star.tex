I heard you on     the wireless back   in fifty two
Lying      a-wake  in bed then  tuning in on    you
If I was     young it didn't   stop you coming  through
Oh - ah - oh.

<D>They took the <G6>credit for your <Asus4/A>second sympho<A/Asus4/A>ny
Rewritten     by machine and  new technology
And now I understand the problems you can see
\ks

(Oh-a-oh) I met your children
(Oh-a-oh) What did you tell them ?

<D>Video killed the <A>radio star
<D>Video killed the <A>radio star

<D>Pictures <A>came and <G>broke your heart
<A>(Oh-A-<Bm>oh-oh-oh)

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go
\ks
(Oh-a-oh) You were the first one
(Oh-a-oh) You were the last one

\zr \kr

Pictures came and broke your heart
(Oh-A-oh-oh-oh)

In my    mind and   in my car, we
can't re-wind we've gone to far

(Oh-A-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-A-oh-oh-oh)
