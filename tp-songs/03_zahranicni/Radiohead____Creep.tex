\zs                   
When you were here \Ch{G}{before}

Couldn't look you in the \Ch{B}{eyes}

You look like an \Ch{C}{angel}

Your skin makes me \Ch{Cm}{cry}

\zs
You float like a \Ch{G}{feather}

In a beautiful \Ch{B}{weather}

I wish I was \Ch{C}{special}

You're so fucking \Ch{Cm}{special}
\ks

\zr
But I'm a \Ch{G}{creep} 

I'm a \Ch{B}{wierdo}

What the hell am I doin' \Ch{C}{here}

I don't belong \Ch{Cm}{here}
\kr

I wish I was special....
