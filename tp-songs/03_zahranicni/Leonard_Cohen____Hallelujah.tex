Now I've \Ch{C}{heard} there was a \Ch{Am}{secret} chord

That \Ch{C}{David} played to \Ch{Am}{please} the Lord

But \Ch{F}{you} don't really \Ch{G}{care} for music, \Ch{C}{do} you? \Ch{G}{}

It \Ch{C}{goes} like this, the \Ch{F}{fourth}, the \Ch{G}{fifth}

The \Ch{Am}{minor} fall, the \Ch{F}{major} lift

The \Ch{G}{baffled} king com\Ch{E}{posing}, Halle\Ch{Dmi}{lujah}

Halle\Ch{F}{lujah}, Halle\Ch{Am}{lujah}, Halle\Ch{F}{lujah}

Your faith was strong but you needed proof

You saw her bathing on the roof

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair

And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain

Though I don't even know the name

But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

There's a blaze of light in every word

It doesn't matter which you heard:

The holy or the broken Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much

I couldn't feel so I tried to touch

I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

And even though it all went wrong

I'll stand before the Lord of Song

With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
