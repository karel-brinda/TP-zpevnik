Now I'\Ch{C}{ve} heard there was\Ch{Am}{ a} secret chord

That \Ch{C}{David} played and it \Ch{Am}{pleased} the Lord

But \Ch{F}{you} don't really \Ch{G}{care} for music, \Ch{C}{do} you? \Ch{G}{}

It \Ch{C}{goes} like this, the \Ch{F}{fourth}, the\Ch{G}{ fifth},

The \Ch{Am}{minor} fall, the\Ch{F}{ major} lift,

The \Ch{G}{baffled} king comp\Ch{E}{osing}, Hall\Ch{F}{elujah}.

Halle\Ch{F}{lujah}, Halle\Ch{Am}{lujah}, Hall\Ch{F}{elujah},

Halle\Ch{C}{lu} \Ch{G}{-} \Ch{C}{jah}.  \Ch{G}{}

Your faith was strong but you needed proof,

You saw her bathing on the roof:

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.

She tied you to a kitchen chair,

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair,

And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.

You say I took the name in vain,

Though I don't even know the name,

But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

There's a blaze of light in every word,

It doesn't matter which you heard:

The holy or the broken Hallelujah.

I did my best, it wasn't much,

I couldn't feel so I tried to touch.

I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you.

And even though it all went wrong

I'll stand before the Lord of Song

With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah.
