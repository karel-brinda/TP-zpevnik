It's been a \Ch{G}{hard} \Ch{C}{day's} \Ch{G}{night}, and I've been \Ch{F}{working} like a \Ch{G}{dog}

It's been a hard \Ch{C}{day}'s n\Ch{G}{ight}, I should be s\Ch{F}{leeping} like a\Ch{G}{ log}

But when I \Ch{C}{get} home to you, I find the t\Ch{D7}{hings} that you do

Will make me \Ch{G}{feel} \Ch{C}{al}\Ch{G}{right}

You know I work all day, to get you money to buy you things

And it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

You know I'll be okay

When I'm \Ch{Hmi}{home}, \Ch{Emi}{everything} seems to be \Ch{Hmi}{right}

When I'm \Ch{G}{home}, \Ch{Emi}{feeling} you holding me \Ch{C}{tight}, \Ch{D}{tight}, yeah

It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog

It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do

Will make me feel alright

You know I fee\Ch{C}{l} al\Ch{G}{right}

You kno\Ch{G}{w} I f\Ch{C}{eel} \Ch{F}{al}right \Ch{G}{ }
