It's been a <G>hard <C>day's <G>night, and I've been <F>working like a <G>dog

It's been a hard <C>day's n<G>ight, I should be s<F>leeping like a<G> log

But when I <C>get home to you, I find the t<D7>hings that you do

Will make me <G>feel <C>al<G>right
\ks
\zs

You know I work all day, to get you money to buy you things

And it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone

You know I'll be okay

When I'm <Hmi>home, <Emi>everything seems to be <Hmi>right

When I'm <G>home, <Emi>feeling you holding me <C>tight, <D>tight, yeah
