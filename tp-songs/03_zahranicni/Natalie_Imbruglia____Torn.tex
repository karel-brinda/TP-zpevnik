\Ch{F}{I thought I saw a man brought to life}

\Ch{Ami}{He was warm,} he came around like he was \Ch{Bb}{dignified}

He showed me what it was to cry

\Ch{F}{Well you couldn't be that man I adored}               

\Ch{Ami}{You don't seem to know.} Don't seem to care what your \Ch{Bb}{heart is for}

But I don't know him anymore 

There's \Ch{Dmi}{nothing where he used to lie}

\Ch{C}{My conversation has run dry}

\Ch{Ami}{That's what's going on}

\Ch{C}{Nothing's fine}

I'm \Ch{F}{torn}
\ks

\zr
I'm all out of \Ch{C}{faith, this is how I} \Ch{Dmi}{feel}

I'm cold and I am \Ch{Bb}{shamed,} lying naked on the \Ch{F}{floor}

Illusion never \Ch{C}{changed into} something \Ch{Dmi}{real}

I'm wide awake and \Ch{Bb}{I can see} the perfect sky is \Ch{F}{torn}

You're a little \Ch{C}{late,} I'm already \Ch{Dmi}{torn} \Ch{Bb}{}

So I guess the fortune teller's right

I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light

But you crawl beneath my veins and now

I don't care, I have no luck

I don't miss it all that much 

There's just so many things

That I can't touch

I'm torn
