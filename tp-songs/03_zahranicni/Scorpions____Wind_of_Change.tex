\Ch{C}{I follow} the Mosk\Ch{Dmi}{va down} to Gorky \Ch{C}{Park}

Listening to the \Ch{Dmi}{wind of} \Ch{Ami}{chan}\Ch{G}{ge}

\Ch{C}{An August} summer \Ch{Dmi}{night,} soldiers passing \Ch{C}{by}

Listening to the \Ch{Dmi}{wind of} \Ch{Ami}{chan}\Ch{G}{ge}

\zs
The world closing in Did you ever think

That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air, I can feel it everywhere

Blowing with the wind of change

\Ch{C}{Take} \Ch{G}{me to} the \Ch{Dmi}{magic of the} \Ch{G7}{moment} on a \Ch{C}{glory} \Ch{G}{night}

Where the \Ch{Dmi}{children of to}\Ch{G}{morrow} dream \Ch{Ami}{away} in the wind of \Ch{G}{change}

\zs
Walking down the street distant memories

Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park

Listening to the wind of change
\ks

\zr
Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change

\zs
\Ch{Ami}{The wind of} change blows \Ch{G}{straight} into the face of \Ch{Ami}{time}

Like a stormwind that will \Ch{G}{ring} the freedom bell for peace of \Ch{C}{mind}

Let your balalaika \Ch{Dmi}{sing} what my guitar wants to \Ch{E}{say}
\ks

\zr
Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change
