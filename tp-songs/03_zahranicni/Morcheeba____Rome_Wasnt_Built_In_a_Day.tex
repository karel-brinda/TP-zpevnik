You and \Ch{C}{me,} we're meant to be

Walking \Ch{B}{free} in harmo\Ch{F}{ny}

One fine \Ch{C}{day} we'll fly away

Don't you know that \Ch{B}{Rome wasn't} built in a \Ch{F}{day}

Hey, hey, \Ch{C}{hey!}
\kr

\zs
In \Ch{C}{this} day and \Ch{B}{age it's so} easy to \Ch{C}{stress}

'Cause people are \Ch{F}{strange} and you can never second \Ch{G}{guess}

In order to \Ch{B}{love, child,} we got to be \Ch{C}{strong}

I'm caught in the \Ch{F}{crossfire,} why can't we get a\Ch{G}{long?} \Ch{F}{}

I'm having a daydream, we're getting somewhere

I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair

I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right

Though we know we were wrong, we can't give up the fight, oh no
