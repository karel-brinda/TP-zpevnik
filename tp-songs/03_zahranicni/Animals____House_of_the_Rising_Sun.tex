My mother was a tailor, she sewed my new bluejeans

My father was a gamblin' man down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and trunk

And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on drunk

Oh mother tell your children not to do what I have done

Spend your lives in sin and misery in the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform, the other foot on the train

I'm goin' back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun

And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy and God I know I'm one
