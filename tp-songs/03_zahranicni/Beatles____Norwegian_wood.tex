\Ch{D}{I on}ce had a girl or should I say, \Ch{C}{she o}nce \Ch{G}{had} \Ch{D}{me}

She showed me her room, isn't it good, \Ch{C}{Norwe}\Ch{G}{gian} \Ch{D}{wood}

She \Ch{Dmi}{asked} me to stay and she told me to sit any\Ch{G}{where}

But \Ch{Dmi}{I look}ed around and I noticed there wasn't a \Ch{Emi}{chair} \Ch{A7}{}

I sat on a rug biding my time, drinking her wine

We talked until two and then she said: ``It's time for bed''

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh

I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

\Ch{D}{And} when I awoke I was alone, \Ch{C}{this bird} \Ch{G}{had} \Ch{D}{flown}

So I lit a fire, isn't it good, \Ch{C}{Norwe}\Ch{G}{gian} \Ch{D}{wood?}
