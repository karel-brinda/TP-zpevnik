The warden threw a party in the county jail

The prison band was there and they began to wail

The band was jumping and the joint began to swing

You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock everybody let's rock

Everybody in the whole cell block

Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone

Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone

The drummer boy from Illinois went crash boom bang

The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Number forty seven said to number three

You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see

I sure would be delighted with your company

Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me

The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone

Way over in the corner weeping all alone

The warden said hey buddy don't you be no square

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair

Shifty Henry said to Bugs for heaven's sake

No one's looking nows our chance to make a break

Bugs turned to Shifty and he said nix nix

I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks
