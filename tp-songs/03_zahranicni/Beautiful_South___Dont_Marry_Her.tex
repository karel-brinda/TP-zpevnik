\zp{Don't marry her}{Beautiful South}

\Ch{C}{Think} of you with \Ch{G}{pipe} and slippers, \Ch{Fmaj7}{Think} of her in \Ch{G}{bed}

\Ch{Fmaj7}{Laying} there just \Ch{C}{watching} telly then \Ch{D}{think} of me \Ch{G}{instead}

I'll \Ch{C}{never} grow so \Ch{G}{old} and flabby, \Ch{Fmaj7}{that} could never \Ch{G}{be}

\Ch{Fmaj7}{Don't} marry \Ch{G}{her}, have \Ch{C}{me}

Your love light shines like cardboard, but your work shoes are glistening

She's a PHD in 'I told you so', you've a knighthood in 'I'm not listening'

She'll grab your Sandra Bullocks and slowly raise the knee

Don't marry her, have me
\ks

And the \Ch{C}{Sunday} sun shines down on San Fran\Ch{Fmaj7}{cisco} Bay

And you \Ch{Fmaj7}{realise} you can't make it \Ch{C}{anyway}

You have to wash the car, take the \Ch{Fmaj7}{kiddies} to the \Ch{C}{park},

\Ch{Fmaj7}{Don't} marry \Ch{G}{her}, have \Ch{C}{me}

Those lovely Sunday mornings, with breakfast brought in bed

Those blackbirds look like knitting needles trying to peck your head

Those birds will peck your soul out and throw away the key

Don't marry her, have me

And the kitchen's always tidy, the bathroom's always clean

She's a diploma in 'just hiding things', you've a first in 'low esteem'

When your socks smell of angels, but your life smells of Brie

Don't marry her, have me
