\zp{Where the Wild Roses Grow}{Leonard Cohen and Nick Cave}

They \Ch{Em}{call} me The Wild \Ch{Am}{Rose} \Ch{Em}{but} my \Ch{G}{name} was Elisa \Ch{B}{Day}

Why they \Ch{Em}{call} me it I do not \Ch{Am}{know} \Ch{Em}{for} my name was \Ch{D}{Elisa} \Ch{Em}{Day}

From the \Ch{Em}{first} day I saw her I knew \Ch{G}{she} was the one 

She \Ch{Am}{stared} in my eyes and \Ch{B}{smiled}

For her \Ch{Em}{lips} were the color of the \Ch{G}{roses} 

They \Ch{Am}{grew} down the river, all \Ch{B}{bloody} and wild

Elisa:
\zs
When he knocked on my door and entered the room

My trembling subsided in his sure embrace

He would be my first man, and with a careful hand

He wiped the tears that ran down my face

He:
\zs
On the second day I brought her a flower

She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen

I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow

So sweet and scarlet and free?"
\ks


Elisa:
\zs
On the second day he came with a single rose

Said: "Will you give me your loss and your sorrow?"

I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed

He said, "If I show you the roses will you follow?"

Elisa:
\zs
On the third day he took me to the river

He showed me the roses and we kissed

And the last thing I heard was a muttered word

As he stood smiling above me with a rock in his fist 
\ks

He:
\zs
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow

She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief

And I kissed her goodbye, I said, "All beauty must die"

And I lent down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth 
\ks
\zr
They call me The Wild Rose but my name was Elisa Day

Why they call me it I do not know

For my \Ch{Em}{name} was \Ch{D}{Elisa} \Ch{Em}{Day}

For my \Ch{Em}{name} was \Ch{D}{Elisa} \Ch{Em}{Day}

For my \Ch{Em}{name} was \Ch{D}{Elisa} \Ch{Em}{Day}
