I hurt myself today to see if I still feel, 

I focus on the pain, the only thing that's real.

The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting,

try to kill it all away, but I remember every<G>thing.

<Ami>What have I beco<F>me, <C>my sweetest f<G>riend ?

Everyone I know goes away in the end.

And you could have it all, my empire of dirt,

I will let you down, I will make you hurt.

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair,

full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.

Beneath the stains of time the feeling disappears,

you are someone else, I am still right here. 
\ks

\zr
What have I become,  my sweetest friend?

Everyone I know goes away in the end.

And you could have it all, my empire of dirt,

I will let you down, I will make you hurt. 

If I could start again, a million miles away,

I would keep myself, I would  

find a way.
