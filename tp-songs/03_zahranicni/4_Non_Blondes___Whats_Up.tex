\Ch{A}{Twenty} Five years and my life is still, \Ch{Bm}{trying} to get up 

that great big hill of \Ch{D}{hope} for a desti\Ch{A}{nation}

I realized quickly when I knew that I should, that the \Ch{Bm}{world} was made of this

brotherhood of \Ch{D}{man} For whatever that \Ch{A}{means}

\Ch{A}{And} So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed, just to \Ch{Bm}{get} it all out

whats in my head and I, \Ch{D}{I} am feeling a little pe\Ch{A}{culiar}.

\Ch{A}{So} I wake in the morning and I step outside and I \Ch{Bm}{take} a deep breath 

and I get real high and I \Ch{D}{Scream} at the top of my lungs  WHATS GOIN \Ch{A}{ON}?

And I \Ch{A}{try}, oh my god do I \Ch{Bm}{try} I try all the \Ch{D}{time}, in this insti\Ch{A}{tution}
