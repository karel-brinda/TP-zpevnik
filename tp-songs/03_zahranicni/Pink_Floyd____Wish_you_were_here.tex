\Ch{C}{So}, so you think you can \Ch{D}{tell}

Heaven from \Ch{Ami}{hell}, blue sky from \Ch{G}{pain}

Can you tell a green \Ch{D}{field} from a cold steel \Ch{C}{rail}

A smile from a \Ch{Ami}{veil}

Do you think you can \Ch{G}{tell}?

And did they get you to {trade} your heroes for {ghosts}

Hot ashes for {trees}, hot air for a cool {breeze}

Cold comfort for {change}
and did you exchange

A walk on part in the {war}

For a lead role in a cage?

{How} I wish, how I wish you were {here}

We're just {two} lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, {year} after year

{Running} over the same old ground, what {have} we found?

The same old {fears}

Wish you were {here}!
