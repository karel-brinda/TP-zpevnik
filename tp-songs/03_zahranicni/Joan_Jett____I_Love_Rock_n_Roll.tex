I \Ch{E}{saw} him dancin' there by the record machine

I knew he must have been about seven\Ch{H}{teen}

The \Ch{A}{beat} was goin' \Ch{H}{strong,} \Ch{E}{playin'} my favourite \Ch{A}{song}

/: And I could \Ch{H}{tell} it wouldn't be \Ch{A}{long}

Till he was with \Ch{H}{me, yeah, me} :/ singin'

He smiled so I got up an' asked for his name

``That don't matter,'' he said, ``'cause it's all the same

Soon I'll take you home where we can be alone''

An' next we were movin' on

He was with me, yeah me

Playin' around and singing the same old song,

yeah, with me, singin'
