\zp{Leaving on a jet plane}{Chantal Kreviazuk}

\zs
All my \Ch{D}{bags} are packed, I'm \Ch{G}{ready} to go

I'm \Ch{D}{standing} here out\Ch{G}{side} your door

I \Ch{D}{hate} to wake you \Ch{G}{up to} say good\Ch{A}{bye}

But the \Ch{D}{dawn} is breakin', it's \Ch{G}{early} morn'

The \Ch{D}{taxi's} waitin', he's \Ch{G}{blowin'} his horn

Al\Ch{D}{ready} I'm so \Ch{G}{lonesome} I could \Ch{A}{cry}

So kiss me and smile for me

Tell me that you'll wait for me

Hold me like you'll never let me go

I'm leavin' on a jet plane

I don't know when I'll be back again

Oh, babe, I hate to go

\zs
There's so many times I've let you down

So many times I've played around

I tell you now, they don't mean a thing

Every place I go, I'll think of you

Every song I sing, I'll sing for you

When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring
\ks

\zs
Now the time has come to leave you

One more time, let me kiss you

Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way

Dream about the days to come

When I won't have to leave alone

About the times, I won't have to say
