\Ch{A}{Twent'}-five years and my life is still

\Ch{Hmi}{Trying} to get up that great big hill of \Ch{D}{hope}

For a desti\Ch{A}{nation}

I realized quickly when I knew that I should

That the \Ch{Hmi}{world} was made of this brotherhood of \Ch{D}{man}

For whatever that \Ch{A}{means}

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed

Just to get it all out what's in my head and I

I'm feeling a little peculiar

So I wake in the morning and I step outside and I

Take a deep breath and I get real high and I

Scream at the top of my lungs: ``What's going on?''

/: And I say: ``Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey''

I say: ``Hey, what's going on?'' :/

And I try, oh my God do I try, I try all the time, in this institution

And I pray, oh my God do I pray, I pray every single day for a revolution
