\Ch{Hmi}{On a} dark desert highway,
\Ch{F#}{cool} wind in my hair

\Ch{A}{Warm} smell of colitas
\Ch{E}{rising} up through the air

\Ch{G}{Up} a head in the distance,
I \Ch{D}{saw} a shimmering light

My \Ch{Emi}{head} grew heavy and my sight grew dim,
I \Ch{F#}{had} to stop for the night

\zs
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell

And I was thinking to myself
this could be heaven or this could be hell

Then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way

There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say:
\ks

\zr
\Ch{G}{Welcome} to the Hotel Cali\Ch{D}{fornia}

Such a \Ch{Emi}{lovely} place (such a lovely place),
such a \Ch{Hmi7}{lovely} face

\Ch{G}{Plenty} of room at the Hotel Cali\Ch{D}{fornia}

Any \Ch{Emi}{time} of year (any time of year),
you can \Ch{F#}{find} it here
\kr

\zs
Her mind is Tiffany twisted,
she got a Mercedes Benz

She got a lot of pretty,
pretty boys that she calls friends

How they dance in the courtyard,
sweet summer sweat

Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget
\ks

\zs
So I called up the captain:
``Please bring me more wine

We haven't had that spirit
here since nineteen sixty-nine.''

And still those voices are calling from far away

Wake you up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say:
\ks

\zr
Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place),
such a lovely face

They livin'it up at the Hotel California

What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise),
bring your alibis
\kr

\zs
Mirrors on the ceiling,
the pink champagne on ice, (and she said,)

``We are all just prisoners here of our own device.''

And in the master's chambers
they gathered for the feast

They stab it with their steely knives,
but they can't kill the beast
\ks

\zs
Last thing I remember,
I was running for the door

I had to find the passage
back to the place I was before

``Relax,'' said the night man,
``we are programmed to receive

You can check out any time you like,
but you can never leave''
\ks
