I'd \Ch{Ami}{rather be} a sparrow than a \Ch{C}{snail}

Yes I would, if I could, I surely \Ch{Ami}{would}

I'd rather be a hammer than a \Ch{C}{nail}

Yes I would, if I only could, I surely \Ch{Ami}{would}

\zr
A\Ch{F}{way,} I'd rather sail away

Like a \Ch{C}{swan} that's here and gone

A \Ch{F}{man} gets tied up to the ground

He gives the \Ch{C}{world} its saddest sound

Its saddest \Ch{Ami}{sound}

I'd rather be a forest than a street

Yes I would, if I could, I surely would

I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet

Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
