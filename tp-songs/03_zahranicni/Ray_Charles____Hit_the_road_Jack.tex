Hit the \Ch{Ami}{road} \Ch{G}{Jack,} \Ch{F}{don}'t you come \Ch{E7}{back}

No more, no more, no more, no more

Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

Old woman, old woman, don't treat me so mean

You're the meanest woman I've ever seen

I guess if you say so

I'll have to pack my things and go

Now baby, listen baby, don't-a treat me this-a way

For I'll be back on my feet some day

Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood

You ain't got no money you just ain't no good


Well, I guess if you say so

I'd have to pack my things and go (That's right)
