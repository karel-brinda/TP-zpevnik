When the <A>night has come

And the <F#mi>land is dark

And the <D>moon is the <E>only light we'll <A>see

No, I won't be afraid

No, I won't be afraid

Just as long as you stand, stand by me
\ks

So, darling, darling, stand by me

Oh, stand by me

Oh, stand, stand by me

Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon

Should tumble and fall

Or the mountain should crumble in the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry

No, I won't shed a tear

Just as long as you stand, stand by me
\ks

Every breath you take

Every move you make

Every bond you break

Every step you take

I'll be watching you
\ks

\zs
Every single day

Every word you say

Every game you play

Every night you stay

I'll be watching you
\ks

\zr
O can't you see

You belong to me

Oh my poor heart aches 

with every step you take
\kr

\zs
Every move you make

Every vow you break

Every smile you fake

Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you
\ks

\zs
Since you've gone 

I been lost without a trace

I dream at night I can only see your face

I look around but it's you I can't replace

I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

I keep crying baby, baby please
\ks

\zr
Oh, can't you see

You belong to me?

How my poor heart aches 

With every step you take
\kr

\zs
Every move you make

Every vow you break

Every smile you fake, 

every claim you stake

I'll be watching you
\ks

\zs
Every move you make, 

every step you take

I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you.
