\Ch{C}{Somewhere} \Ch{Emi}{over} the rainbow, \Ch{F}{way} up \Ch{C}{high}

\Ch{F}{And} the \Ch{C}{dreams} that you dream of \Ch{G}{once} in a lulla\Ch{Ami}{by}  \Ch{F}{ }
\ks
\zs
Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly

And the dreams that you dream of, dreams really do come true
\ks
\zr

Some\Ch{C}{day} I'll wish upon a star,
\Ch{G}{wake} up where the clouds are far be\Ch{Ami}{hind} \Ch{F}{me}

Where\Ch{C}{ trouble} melts like lemon drops

\Ch{G}{High} above the chimney tops is \Ch{Ami}{where} you'll \Ch{F}{find} me
\kr
\zs
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly

And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?
\ks
\zr
Someday I'll wish upon a star, wake up where the clouds are far behind me

Where trouble melts like lemon drops

High above the chimney tops is where you'll find me
\kr
\zs
Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high

And the dreams that you dare to, oh why, oh why can't I?
