<Am>Never know how much I <C>love you, <Dm>never know how much I <Am>care

When you put your arms <C>around me, I get a <E>fever that's so hard to <Am>bear

You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night

You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight

Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night
