I \Ch{A}{hate the world today.}\Ch{E}{~}\Ch{D}{} You're so good to me I \Ch{A}{know but I can't change}\Ch{E}{~}\Ch{D}{}

Tried to tell you but you \Ch{F#m}{look at me like maybe}

I'm and \Ch{B7}{angel} underneath \Ch{D}{innocent and sweet}

Yesterday I cried. You must have been relieved to see the softer side

I can understand how you'd be so confused I don't envy you

I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one

I'm a \Ch{A}{bitch I'm} a lover I'm a \Ch{E}{child I'm a mother}

I'm a \Ch{Bm}{sinner} I'm a saint \Ch{D}{I do not feel ashamed}

I'm your \Ch{A}{hell I'm your} dream I'm \Ch{E}{nothing in between}

You know you \Ch{F#m}{wouldn't} want it any other \Ch{D}{way}

So take me as I am. This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man

Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous

And I'm going to extreme tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

I'm a bitch I'm a tease I'm a goddess on my knees

When you hurt when you suffer I'm your angel undercover

I've been numb I'm revived can't say I'm not alive

You know I wouldn't want it any other way
