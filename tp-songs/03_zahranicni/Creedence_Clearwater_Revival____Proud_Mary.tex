\Ch{D}{Left} a good job in the city,

Workin for the man every night and day

And I never lost one minute of sleepin'

Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

\Ch{A}{Big} wheels keep on turnin'

\Ch{Hmi}{Pro}ud  Mary keep on \Ch{G}{burnin'}

/: \Ch{D}{Roll}in', rollin', rollin' on the river :/

{Cleaned} a lot of plates in Memphis

Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans

But I never saw the good side of the city

Till I hitched a ride \Ch{A}{on} a river boat queen

\Ch{D}{If} you come down to the river

Bet you're gonna find some people who live

You don't have to worry, 'cause you have no money

People on the river are \Ch{A}{happy} to give
