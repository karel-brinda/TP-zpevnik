            \Ch{F}{I thought I saw a man brought to life}

            \Ch{Am}{He was warm,} he came around like he was \Ch{Bb}{dignified}

            He showed me what it was to cry

            \Ch{F}{Well you couldn't be that man I adored}               

            \Ch{Am}{You don't seem to know.} Don't seem to care what your \Ch{Bb}{heart is for}

            But I don't know him anymore 

                 \Ch{Dm}{There's nothing where he used to lie}

                 \Ch{C}{My conversation has run dry}

                 \Ch{Am}{That's what's going on}

                 \Ch{C}{Nothing's fine}

                 I'm \Ch{F}{torn}

             \Ch{F}{I'm all out of} \Ch{C}{faith, this is how I} \Ch{Dm}{feel}

             I'm cold and \Ch{Bb}{I am shamed,} lying naked on the \Ch{F}{floor}

             Illusion never \Ch{C}{changed, into} something \Ch{Dm}{real}

             I'm wide awake \Ch{Bb}{and I can see,} the perfect sky is \Ch{F}{torn}

             You're a little \Ch{C}{late,} I'm already \Ch{Dm}{torn} \Ch{Bb}{}

            So I guess the fortune teller's right

            I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light

            But you crawl beneath my veins and now

                I don't care, I have no luck

                I don't miss it all that much 

                There's just so many things

                That I can't touch

                I'm torn
