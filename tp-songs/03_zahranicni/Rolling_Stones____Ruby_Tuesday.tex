\Ch{Ami}{She} would \Ch{G}{never} \Ch{F}{say} \Ch{G}{where} she came \Ch{C}{from} \Ch{F}{} \Ch{C}{}

\Ch{Ami}{Yesterday} \Ch{G}{don't} \Ch{F}{matter} \Ch{C}{if} it's \Ch{G}{gone} \Ch{C}{} \Ch{G}{}

\Ch{Ami}{While} the \Ch{D7}{sun} is \Ch{G}{bright}

Or \Ch{Ami}{in the} \Ch{D7}{darkest} \Ch{G}{night}

No one \Ch{C}{knows} \Ch{F}{} \Ch{C}{} she comes and \Ch{G}{goes} \Ch{C}{} \Ch{G}{}

\Ch{C}{Good}\Ch{G}{bye} \Ch{C}{Ruby} Tuesday

Who could \Ch{G}{hang} a name \Ch{C}{on} you?

\Ch{C}{When} you \Ch{G}{change} with \Ch{F}{ev'ry} new day

\Ch{G}{Still} I'm gonna \Ch{C}{miss} you \Ch{G}{}

Don't question why she needs to be so free

She'll tell you it's the only way to be

She just can't be chained

To a life where nothing's gained

And nothing's lost at such a cost

There's no time to loose I heard her say

Cash your dream before they slip away

Dying all the time

Lose your dreams and you

Will loose your mind, ain't life unkind
