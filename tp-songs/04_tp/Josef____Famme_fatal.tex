Then she told me that they broke up and she‘s single now 

On the bridge, sunset was glowing like an explosion somehow

after I turned red like a boy on a traffic light

did she notice? No? That must have been quite tight.

The night went on, we went to a full vibrant bar

had a coctails cause without them we wouldn't make it so far

our friend was dancing with an italian guy

and I must say that he clearly wasn't shy

\zs
I tried some of his moves on my lovely partner

and she just smiled and started to shiver like a panter

Time had stopped and I wasn't able to think clearly

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ and then I kissed her - nearly.
